* Learning Github for college projects
* Github is important for college projects because it provides tools that make collaborations, version control and code management much easier. It also helps in portfolio building and open source learning. Overall, it is a valuable platform that helps students gain practical experience in software development.
* My goals with github: I want to first of all get the grasp of proper wowrking of Github. I want to contribute in open source projects which would help me as well as others. I also would like to interact with the Github community.
* Steps that I will take to get comfortable with Github: I will understand Git and version control basics and learn the Git workflow. I will collaborate using pull requests and continue to explore Github features.
